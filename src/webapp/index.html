            <h2>Welcome to Street Croquet</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the world of Street Croquet, where the refined art of traditional croquet meets the raw energy of urban life. This is not your grandmother's croquet - this is a sport for the modern urban sophisticate who appreciates both tradition and innovation.</p>
            <p>Street Croquet combines the strategic depth of traditional croquet with the unpredictable elements of urban terrain, creating a sport that demands both finesse and street smarts.</p>

            <div class="rules-intro">
                <p>It's important to get moving and enjoy some fresh air. What better way to do that than with a competitive game of croquet to prove who's the best? For this purpose, there's no better sport than Street Croquet!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rules-section">
                <h3>Basic Requirements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Street Croquet requires a minimum of 4 players, as each team must have at least 2 players, and the game needs 2 teams.</li>
                    <li>For a match to be considered official Street Croquet, there must be a sparkling wine, Cava, Cremant or Champagne involved, which must be consumed during the game.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="rules-section">

                    <li>Once the course is ready, the builders must give a thorough explanation of its layout and challengesâ€”both forward and backward.</li>
                    <li>This is concluded with a Hellerup applause by the builders.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="rules-section">

                    <li>The leading team must not lob the ball. They must strike using the end of the mallet.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="rules-section">
                <h3>Winning Conditions</h3>
                <p>The winner is the team that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Completes the course.</li>
                    <li>Turns around the second starting post.</li>
                    <li>Returns and hits the first starting post first.</li>

                    <li>Sportsmanship is NOT expected. Winners win, losers lose. There is only one winning team in Street Croquet.</li>
                    <li>Beyond these rules, regular garden croquet rules apply.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="rules-section">
                <h3>Penalty Shots</h3>
                <p style="font-style: italic;">This addition to the rules are still under review by official comitee</p>
                <p>Penalty shots are conducted in the event of a draw between one or more balls. It takes place after the main game has finished.</p>

                    <li>1 meter from the gate (in the opposite direction of the post), place the starting grass.</li>

                <ul>

                    <li>The goal is to pass through the gate and hit the post.</li>
                    <li>If a team hits the post on the first shot, they are declared the winner immediately, and remaining teams do not get to shoot.</li>
                    <li>If no team hits the post, the closest ball to the post wins.</li>
                    <li>If there is another tie, the penalty shots continue until a winner is determined.</li>
